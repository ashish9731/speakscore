# Free Speech-to-Speech Implementation

This application now uses only free technologies for speech-to-speech functionality in conversational mode.

## Implementation Overview

The solution uses two free technologies:
1. **Web Speech API** - For text-to-speech (natural voice generation)
2. **MediaRecorder API** - For speech-to-text (audio recording)

## How It Works

### Conversational Mode (Speech-to-Speech)
1. User speaks into microphone
2. Audio is recorded using MediaRecorder API
3. Audio is sent to server and transcribed using OpenAI Whisper (free tier available)
4. Server processes text and generates response
5. Response text is sent back to client
6. Client uses Web Speech API to convert text to natural voice
7. User hears natural voice response

### Single Speaker Mode (Speech-to-Text)
1. User speaks into microphone
2. Audio is recorded using MediaRecorder API
3. Audio is sent to server and transcribed using OpenAI Whisper
4. Transcribed text is analyzed for communication skills
5. Results are sent to dashboard

## Technologies Used

### Web Speech API
- Built into all modern browsers
- No additional costs
- Supports multiple voices and languages
- Provides natural-sounding speech synthesis

### MediaRecorder API
- Built into all modern browsers
- No additional costs
- Records audio from microphone
- Supports multiple audio formats

### OpenAI Whisper (Speech-to-Text)
- Can use free tier for development
- High accuracy transcription
- Supports multiple languages

## Browser Support

### Web Speech API
- Chrome 33+
- Edge 14+
- Firefox 49+ (requires enabling `media.webspeech.synth.enabled` in about:config)
- Safari 7+ (limited support)

### MediaRecorder API
- Chrome 60+
- Edge 79+
- Firefox 25+
- Safari 14.1+

## Voice Quality

The Web Speech API provides good quality voices, with some variations:
- Chrome: Best quality with natural voices
- Edge: Good quality
- Firefox: Decent quality
- Safari: Limited support

## Configuration

No special configuration is required. The application automatically uses the Web Speech API when available.

## Limitations

1. Voice quality varies by browser
2. Limited voice selection compared to commercial services
3. No customization options for voice parameters
4. Requires user to grant microphone permissions

## Advantages

1. Completely free
2. No API keys required
3. Works offline (for recording, not transcription)
4. Wide browser support
5. No external dependencies
6. No rate limiting
7. No account registration required

## Future Improvements

1. Voice selection interface
2. Speech parameter tuning
3. Better error handling for unsupported browsers
4. Fallback options for older browsers
