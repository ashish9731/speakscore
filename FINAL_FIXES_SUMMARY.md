## How to Run the Application

### Prerequisites
1. Node.js installed
2. OpenAI API key in `.env` file

### Starting the Application
```bash
# Terminal 1: Start the backend server
npm start

# Terminal 2: Start the frontend development server
cd client
npm start
```

### Accessing the Application
- Frontend: http://localhost:3000
- Backend: http://localhost:5001

## Testing the Application

1. Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser
2. Click "Begin Your Assessment Now"
3. Select either "Conversational Mode" or "Single Speaker Mode"
4. Allow microphone access when prompted
5. Click "Start Speaking" and speak naturally
6. For conversational mode, you'll hear responses through your speakers
7. Click "End Assessment" when finished
8. View detailed analysis on the dashboard

## Troubleshooting

### If the application shows "Disconnected":
1. Check that both backend and frontend servers are running
2. Verify ports 3000 (frontend) and 5001 (backend) are not blocked
3. Check browser console for WebSocket connection errors

### If microphone is not working:
1. Ensure browser has microphone permissions
2. Check that no other application is using the microphone
3. Try refreshing the page

### If there are build errors:
1. Ensure all dependencies are installed: `npm install` in both root and client directories
2. Check that the public directory contains all required files

## Next Steps

1. Deploy to production environment
2. Add more assessment topics
3. Implement user authentication
4. Add progress tracking
5. Include additional languages
