# Communication Assessment Interview Bot - Hybrid Speech Implementation

## Implementation Overview

This update implements a hybrid speech system as requested:

1. **Conversational Mode**: Speech-to-Speech (user speaks, system responds with synthetic speech)
2. **Single Speaker Mode**: Speech-to-Text (user speaks, system transcribes for analysis)

## Key Changes Made

### 1. OpenAI Service Enhancement
- Added `generateSpeech` function using OpenAI TTS
- Maintained `transcribeAudio` function using OpenAI Whisper
- Kept `analyzeConversation` function using GPT-3.5 Turbo

### 2. Server Implementation
- Updated to handle both speech-to-speech and speech-to-text workflows
- Integrated OpenAI TTS for conversational mode responses
- Maintained OpenAI Whisper for audio transcription in both modes
- Preserved existing analysis and scoring functionality

### 3. Frontend Updates
- Added audio playback functionality for conversational mode
- Maintained recording interface for both modes
- Updated UI to reflect mode-specific functionality
- Added proper audio resource management

### 4. Workflow Implementation

#### Conversational Mode Workflow:
1. User selects "Conversational Mode"
2. System provides interview questions via synthetic speech
3. User clicks "Start Speaking" to respond
4. Speech is captured and recorded as audio
5. Audio is sent to server and transcribed using OpenAI Whisper
6. Transcribed text is processed for conversation flow
7. System generates text response and converts to synthetic speech using OpenAI TTS
8. Synthetic speech is played back to user
9. Conversation continues until completion
10. OpenAI analyzes full conversation for detailed feedback

#### Single Speaker Mode Workflow:
1. User selects "Single Speaker Mode"
2. System provides speaking topics
3. User clicks "Start Speaking" to begin
4. Speech is captured and recorded as audio
5. Audio is sent to server and transcribed using OpenAI Whisper
6. User can stop and restart recording as needed
7. Assessment progresses through multiple topics
8. OpenAI analyzes transcribed speech content for detailed feedback

## Technical Implementation Details

### Backend Changes
1. **OpenAI Integration**
   - TTS: `tts-1` model with `alloy` voice
   - Whisper: `whisper-1` model for transcription
   - GPT: `gpt-3.5-turbo` for conversation analysis

2. **Audio Processing**
   - Base64 audio encoding/decoding
   - Temporary file management for Whisper processing
   - MP3 generation for TTS responses
   - Proper error handling and cleanup

3. **Mode-Specific Logic**
   - Conditional speech generation for conversational mode
   - Universal transcription for both modes
   - Appropriate response handling per mode

### Frontend Changes
1. **Audio Playback**
   - HTML5 Audio API integration
   - Automatic playback of system responses
   - Proper resource cleanup

2. **Recording Interface**
   - MediaRecorder API for audio capture
   - Base64 encoding for transmission
   - Visual feedback for recording state

3. **UI/UX Updates**
   - Mode-specific instructions
   - Clear indication of current mode
   - Responsive design for both modes

## API Usage

### OpenAI TTS (Text-to-Speech)
- Model: tts-1
- Voice: alloy (configurable)
- Format: MP3
- Purpose: Generate synthetic speech responses in conversational mode

### OpenAI Whisper (Speech-to-Text)
- Model: whisper-1
- Language: en (English)
- Format: Audio file transcription
- Purpose: Convert user speech to text in both modes

### OpenAI GPT-3.5 Turbo (Analysis)
- Model: gpt-3.5-turbo
- Purpose: Conversation analysis and scoring
- Temperature: 0.3 (for consistent results)
- Max Tokens: 1500

## Data Flow

### Conversational Mode:
1. User Audio → MediaRecorder → Base64 → Server
2. Server → Whisper Transcription → Text Processing
3. Text Response → OpenAI TTS → MP3 Audio
4. MP3 Audio → Base64 → Client → HTML5 Audio Playback
5. Full Conversation → GPT Analysis → Dashboard

### Single Speaker Mode:
1. User Audio → MediaRecorder → Base64 → Server
2. Server → Whisper Transcription → Text Processing
3. Text Analysis → Progress Tracking
4. Full Conversation → GPT Analysis → Dashboard

## Error Handling

### Audio Processing
- Browser compatibility checking
- Microphone access error handling
- Audio recording state management
- Network error handling for WebSocket

### OpenAI Integration
- API error handling and fallbacks
- Temporary file cleanup on errors
- Graceful degradation to algorithm-based scoring
- Detailed error logging

## Security Considerations

### Data Privacy
- Audio data processed temporarily
- No permanent storage of audio files
- Immediate cleanup of temporary files
- Secure WebSocket communication

### API Keys
- Environment variable configuration
- Server-side API key management
- No client-side exposure of API keys

## Future Enhancements

### 1. Advanced Audio Features
- Support for different TTS voices
- Audio quality enhancement
- Real-time audio analysis
- Pronunciation assessment

### 2. Enhanced User Experience
- Visual waveform display
- Recording timer and indicators
- Playback controls for system responses
- Multi-language support

### 3. Improved Analysis
- Pronunciation scoring
- Intonation pattern analysis
- Pace and rhythm evaluation
- Emotional tone detection

## Implementation Notes

### Current State
- Uses OpenAI TTS for speech generation in conversational mode
- Uses OpenAI Whisper for speech transcription in both modes
- Uses OpenAI GPT-3.5 Turbo for conversation analysis
- Supports Indian English through language settings
- Provides TOEFL-style scoring (0-30 scale)
- Maintains both assessment modes with appropriate workflows

### Production Considerations
- Implement rate limiting for API usage
- Add audio file size validation
- Implement more robust error recovery
- Add monitoring and logging for API usage
- Consider caching for repeated analysis requests
- Optimize audio processing for real-time performance
