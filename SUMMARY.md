### Services
- Google Cloud Text-to-Speech API
- OpenAI GPT-3.5 Turbo API
- Custom communication scoring algorithms
- In-memory session management

## Key Components

### 1. Conversation Service
Manages the flow of conversation between user and bot, tracking session state and maintaining conversation history.

### 2. Scoring Service
Implements TOEFL-like scoring algorithms to evaluate communication skills based on:
- Fluency analysis (filler words, speech rate, sentence variation)
- Grammar analysis (complex structures, error detection)
- Vocabulary analysis (lexical diversity, advanced word usage)
- Coherence analysis (transition words, logical flow)

### 3. TTS Service
Integrates with Google Cloud Text-to-Speech to generate natural sounding audio for bot responses.

### 4. OpenAI Service
Leverages GPT-3.5 Turbo for advanced conversation analysis and personalized feedback generation.

### 5. Authentication Service
Handles user registration, login, and session management using JWT tokens.
