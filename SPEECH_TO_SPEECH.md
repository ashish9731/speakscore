## How It Works Now

### Conversational Mode
1. User selects "Conversational Mode"
2. System provides interview questions via text
3. User clicks "Start Speaking" to respond
4. Speech is captured and transcribed in real-time
5. Transcribed speech is sent to server for processing
6. System generates appropriate text responses
7. Conversation continues until completion
8. OpenAI analyzes full conversation for detailed feedback

### Single Speaker Mode
1. User selects "Single Speaker Mode"
2. System provides speaking topics
3. User clicks "Start Speaking" to begin
4. Speech is captured and transcribed continuously
5. User can stop and restart recording as needed
6. Assessment progresses through multiple topics
7. OpenAI analyzes speech content for detailed feedback

## Data Flow

1. **Speech Capture**: User speaks into microphone
2. **Speech Recognition**: Web Speech API converts audio to text
3. **Message Processing**: Transcript sent to server via WebSocket
4. **Bot Response**: System generates text response
5. **Assessment Completion**: Full conversation analyzed
6. **OpenAI Analysis**: Detailed scoring and feedback generated
7. **Dashboard Display**: Results shown in TOEFL-style format

## Browser Support

The Web Speech API is supported in:
- Google Chrome (Desktop and Android)
- Microsoft Edge
- Safari (limited support)

Users are notified if their browser doesn't support speech recognition.

## Future Enhancements

### 1. Advanced Speech Processing
- Integration with cloud-based speech APIs (Google Speech-to-Text, Azure Speech Services)
- Real-time speech analysis and feedback
- Pronunciation and intonation evaluation

### 2. Enhanced User Experience
- Audio visualization during recording
- Noise reduction and audio enhancement
- Multi-language support

### 3. Improved Accuracy
- Custom speech recognition models
- Domain-specific vocabulary enhancement
- Context-aware transcription improvements

## Implementation Notes

### Current State
- Uses Web Speech API for speech recognition
- Supports Indian English (en-IN) for appropriate accent recognition
- Provides real-time transcription feedback
- Maintains all existing analysis and scoring functionality

### Production Considerations
- Implement fallback speech recognition services for better accuracy
- Add audio quality preprocessing
- Implement more robust error handling
- Add audio recording capabilities for playback
