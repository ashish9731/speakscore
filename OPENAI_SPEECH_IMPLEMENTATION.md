## How It Works Now

### Conversational Mode
1. User selects "Conversational Mode"
2. System provides interview questions via text
3. User clicks "Start Speaking" to respond
4. Speech is captured and recorded as audio
5. Audio is sent to server and transcribed using OpenAI Whisper
6. Transcribed text is processed for conversation flow
7. System generates appropriate text responses
8. Conversation continues until completion
9. OpenAI analyzes full conversation for detailed feedback

### Single Speaker Mode
1. User selects "Single Speaker Mode"
2. System provides speaking topics
3. User clicks "Start Speaking" to begin
4. Speech is captured and recorded as audio
5. Audio is sent to server and transcribed using OpenAI Whisper
6. User can stop and restart recording as needed
7. Assessment progresses through multiple topics
8. OpenAI analyzes speech content for detailed feedback

## Data Flow

1. **Audio Capture**: User speaks into microphone
2. **Audio Recording**: MediaRecorder API captures audio
3. **Audio Encoding**: Audio converted to base64
4. **Audio Transmission**: Base64 audio sent to server via WebSocket
5. **Audio Transcription**: OpenAI Whisper converts audio to text
6. **Message Processing**: Transcribed text processed for conversation
7. **Bot Response**: System generates text response
8. **Assessment Completion**: Full conversation analyzed
9. **OpenAI Analysis**: Detailed scoring and feedback generated
10. **Dashboard Display**: Results shown in TOEFL-style format

## API Usage

### OpenAI Whisper (Speech-to-Text)
- Model: whisper-1
- Language: en (English)
- Format: Audio file transcription
- Purpose: Convert user speech to text

### OpenAI GPT-3.5 Turbo (Analysis)
- Model: gpt-3.5-turbo
- Purpose: Conversation analysis and scoring
- Temperature: 0.3 (for consistent results)
- Max Tokens: 1500

## Error Handling

### Audio Processing
- Browser compatibility checking
- Microphone access error handling
- Audio recording state management
- Network error handling for WebSocket

### OpenAI Integration
- API error handling and fallbacks
- Temporary file cleanup on errors
- Graceful degradation to algorithm-based scoring
- Detailed error logging

## Security Considerations

### Data Privacy
- Audio data processed temporarily
- No permanent storage of audio files
- Immediate cleanup of temporary files
- Secure WebSocket communication

### API Keys
- Environment variable configuration
- Server-side API key management
- No client-side exposure of API keys

## Future Enhancements

### 1. Advanced Audio Processing
- Support for additional audio formats
- Audio quality preprocessing
- Noise reduction and enhancement
- Real-time audio analysis

### 2. Enhanced Analysis
- Pronunciation assessment
